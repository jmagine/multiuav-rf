# multiuav-rf

Includes radio frequency selection utilities for working with LoStik and XBee modules. These are Python serial controllers which change radio parameters such as frequency, bandwidth, power, and modulation. Additionally, includes simulation for multi-UAV trajectory and frequency control for testing effects of cross-interference in congested environments.

## RF Dependencies
- pyserial
- CH340 (LoStik specific)

## Sim Dependencies
- numpy
- matplotlib
